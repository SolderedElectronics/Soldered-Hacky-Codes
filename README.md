# Soldered Hacky Codes
Useful codes by Soldered Electronics that can speed up the testing and development process.
Use them at your own risk. See the [note](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Hacky-Codes/blob/main/README.md#%EF%B8%8Fnote%EF%B8%8F) at the bottom!

# Useage of this repo - Submitting
- Every code must be inside its own folder. The folder name must be representative of what the code does. Folder names "Test1234" are **NOT ALLOWED** and will be removed!
- Every code must have a readme
- Code **MUST HAVE** comments (must be well documented!)

Steps:
1. Get the latest version of this repo
2. Make a folder
3. Inside the folder make a readme file
4. Copy your code inside the folder
5. Clean up code (build files, .vscode files should not exist, could use .gitignore file).
6. Commit
7. Push
8. Done :)

# README file
Every folder must have readme with:

✅ Details of what specific code does

✅ How to use it and run it

✅ Preferably should be written on how to change some settings

✅ What IDE to use

✅ What type of development board is used

✅ Hardware connections (schematic can be added if needed)

✅ Comments of the limitations of the code, or if something is not working as it should, or something is not done (TODO).

# Other files
If for some reason with sketch some other files must be added, make folder named "extras".
If images are needed, inside "extras" make "images" folder.
