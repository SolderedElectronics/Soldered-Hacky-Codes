# Soldered Hacky Codes
Useful codes by Soldered Electronics that can speed up the testing and development process.
Use them at your own risk. See the [note](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Hacky-Codes/blob/main/README.md#%EF%B8%8Fnote%EF%B8%8F) at the bottom!

# Useage of this repo - Submitting

Steps:
1. Get the latest version of this repo
2. Make a folder
3. Inside the folder make a readme file
4. Copy your code inside the folder
5. Follow the suggested folder structure if something else than code needs to be added
6. Clean up code (build files, .vscode files should not exist, could use .gitignore file)
7. Make sure that the code is well documented
8. Commit
9. Push
10. Done :)

# README file
Every folder must have readme with:

✅ Details of what specific code does

✅ How to use it and run it

✅ Preferably should be written on how to change some settings

✅ What IDE to use

✅ What type of development board is used

✅ Hardware connections (schematic can be added if needed)

✅ Comments on the limitations of the code, or if something is not working as it should, or something is not done (TODO).

# Other files
If for some reason with a sketch, some other files must be added, make a folder named "extras".
If images are needed, inside "extras" make an "images" folder.
