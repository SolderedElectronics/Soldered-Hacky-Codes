# Arduino UART Test code

Check weather UART communication works on Arduino / Dasduino / Inkplate board.

# Usage
- Compile and upload the code on the board.
- If needed, connect USB to UART converter to the UART port that needs to be tested.
- Open Arduino serial monitor.
- Send something.
- Exactly the same thing should echo back but with added header and footer (to be sure that short between RX and TX did not cause echo)

# Connections
Depends on the microcontroller and dev board.

## Tweaks
- No tweaks (it's a simple code :) )

# Notes
- No notes.
